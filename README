= Header Authorize

Header Authorize creates alterations of the Login System to accept Header information for authorization. This allows you to use a central authentication system for multiple applications.

An <code>authenticate_with_header</code> method is added as a before_filter on the ApplicationController. <code>authenticate_with_header<code> will look for a header specified and will allow or disallow based on a user in Radiant having the same value in the given attribute.

This requires that you manage your user accounts so that all active users have valid information listed in the Radiant database.

See HELP_admin.markdown for more details.
